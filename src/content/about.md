Growing up, I always loved art and design. I played PC games, read
comic books, and drew my own interpretations of them. Later on, this
led me to customize MySpace pages and immerse myself in graffiti,
skating, and social media during the early 2000s. Years later, I
picked up a camera and never put it down it became my constant
companion, accompanying me everywhere I went, I captured and edited
weddings, automotive, and amateur MMA fights, where I captured live
shots from ringside. This led to me needing a photography website
for showcasing my work to clients. From there, I discovered that I
find coding - or rather, developing the look and feel of a website -
to be very thrilling.
